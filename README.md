## üöÄ Quick Start

### One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/x1xhlol/zerochat)

*Note: You will need to set up environment variables on Vercel.*

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/x1xhlol/zerochat.git
cd zerochat

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables (see below)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your actual values

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration (`.env.local`)

```env
# Required for Core Functionality
REDIS_URL="your_upstash_redis_url_or_other_redis_instance"
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your_vercel_blob_read_write_token" # For file uploads/profile pictures
ENCRYPTION_SECRET="generate_a_strong_32_byte_secret_key" # Used for encrypting API keys. Use `openssl rand -hex 32`

# Required for Code Execution
E2B_API_KEY="your_e2b_api_key"

# Required for Email Verification & 2FA
RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key" # From Resend.com, ensure domain is verified
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Change to your deployed URL in production

# Required for Scheduled Cleanup (Vercel Cron or other)
CLEANUP_API_TOKEN="generate_a_secure_random_string" # Protects the /api/cleanup/sessions endpoint

# Optional AI Provider API Keys (users can also set these in their profile)
# These act as default fallbacks if a user hasn't set their own.
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=""
GROQ_API_KEY=""
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
# OPENAI_API_KEY=""
# ... any other models supported via OpenRouter or directly

# KV_URL=""
# KV_REST_API_URL=""
# KV_REST_API_TOKEN=""
# KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=""
```

**Important:**
- For `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, generate a secure key using a command like `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- For `RESEND_API_KEY`, you need an account with [Resend](https://resend.com) and a verified domain for sending emails.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` should be your application's base URL. It's used for constructing verification links in emails.
- `CLEANUP_API_TOKEN` is a secret token you define to secure the session cleanup cron job endpoint.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Zero Chat is built with modern, scalable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Server Actions.
- **Database/Cache**: Redis (Upstash recommended) for session management, chat history, real-time sync.
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK, OpenRouter for broad model access.
- **Code Execution**: E2B for secure, sandboxed execution of Python, JavaScript, and HTML.
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob for profile pictures and potential future file attachments.
- **Real-time Communication**: Redis Pub/Sub and Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Authentication**: Custom credential-based authentication with email verification (Resend) and 2FA.
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Vercel Cron for E2B session cleanup.

## üîß Self-Hosting Options

### Vercel + Upstash (Recommended)
- **Frontend & Backend**: Deploy to Vercel.
- **Redis**: Use Upstash Redis (free tier available).
- **Blob Storage**: Vercel Blob (included with Vercel).
- **Email**: Resend (free tier available).
- **Code Execution**: E2B (free tier available).
- **Cron Jobs**: Vercel Cron (included with Vercel).
This setup offers a highly scalable, serverless architecture with minimal configuration.

### Traditional VPS
- **Application**: Run the Next.js app using Node.js (e.g., via Docker).
- **Redis**: Self-host a Redis instance or use a managed cloud Redis.
- **Blob Storage**: Use any S3-compatible storage service (e.g., MinIO, AWS S3). You'll need to adapt file upload logic.
- **Email**: Integrate with any email provider via Resend or adapt to another (e.g., SMTP).
- **Code Execution**: E2B cloud is still recommended for security. Self-hosting a secure code execution sandbox is complex.
- **Cron Jobs**: Use system cron or a similar scheduler to call the cleanup API endpoint.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Zero Chat is built by developers, for developers.

### Contributing Guidelines
1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature`).
3. **Make your changes.** Ensure code is well-formatted (run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`).
4. **Test your changes thoroughly.** Add unit or integration tests where appropriate.
5. **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch with a clear description of your changes.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Voice messages and transcription
- [ ] Team workspaces and advanced collaboration features
- [ ] Local AI model support (e.g., Ollama integration)
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) / Multi-language support
- [ ] Enhanced file management within code execution sandbox

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

- **Data Ownership**: Your conversations and data stay on your infrastructure (Redis, Vercel Blob).
- **API Key Security**: User-provided AI API keys are encrypted at rest using `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`.

- **No Default Telemetry**: Zero Chat does not send telemetry or analytics to external services by default.
- **GDPR & Data Rights**: Built-in features for data export and account deletion.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Configured for enhanced security (review `next.config.mjs`).
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented on sensitive API endpoints.
